LD30: Light and Dark
====

*Ludum Dare 30 (Connected Worlds) Source*

###Description
Control the light and dark sides and reach the exit at the same time on either side to proceed to the next level.

Made with HaxePunk. This was my first attempt at using it for a game, and I'll definitely be using it again.

###Controls:
**Arrow keys or WASD:** Move currently active avatar(s)
**K or X:** Jump with currently active avatar(s)
**L or C:** Switch active avatar (if possible)
**P or space:** Pause (useful for screenshots or debugging)

There's only five levels, so it's pretty short, and I never got around to sound or music (seems to be the norm for me now).
